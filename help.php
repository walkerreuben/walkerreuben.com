            <p>You've reached this page because I gave you a link, and you decided to check it out. If you'd like to say hello, catch up, or even just get some help with something and then ignore me, you've come to the right page. Don't feel bad, I gave you the link for a reason.</p>
            <p>Maybe I'm weird. I don't know. But every now and then I make a connection where I'd <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-C_3eYj-pOM">do anything</a> for that person. I can know them for a month or a year, it doesn't matter. Unless you managed to find this page randomly, you're one of them. So here's how to get in touch.</p>

        <p>And if all else fails, Google me. (And find this site.) Actually, there's a contact form <a href="contact.php">here</a>. But it's currently not working.

            And in case you were wondering, yes, I collect email addresses. I just like to know that I've got that username in case I want to change provider.
